        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Hello, I'm Narik, an arising Software Engineer who aims to specialize in data analytics
            and full stack
            development.
            I currently attend University of California, Irvine as a Business Information Management major. I wish to
            work in the Fintech Industry applying technologies I know
            to improve the world of business and commerce.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am driven by a desire to learn new languages and technologies in attempts to create projects that I find
            interesting.
            I believe given the right passion and desire, one can achieve anything they set their mind to.
            Right now, I am learning how to properly use git on two machines: my laptop, and my PC.
        </p>
