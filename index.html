        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Hello, I'm Narik, an arising Software Engineer who aims to specialize in data analytics and full stack development.
            I currently attend University of California, Irvine as a Business Information Management major.
        </p>
        <p>
        I am driven by a desire to learn new languages and technologies in attempts to create projects that I find interesting.
        I believe given the right passion and desire, one can achieve anything they set their mind to. 
        Right now, I am learning how to properly use git on two machines: my laptop, and my PC. 
        </p>
